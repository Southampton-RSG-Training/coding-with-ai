:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can AI be used effectively as a reference or learning aid rather than a substitute for problem-solving?
- What types of coding tasks benefit most from AI assistance?
- How should developers evaluate and validate AI-generated code, explanations, or fixes?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain why delegating full software development to AI without understanding the solution introduces technical, ethical, and reliability risks.
- Describe appropriate roles for AI tools as assistants rather than autonomous developers.
- Use ChatGPT as a reference tool to locate, summarize, and clarify technical information more precisely than traditional search methods.
- Apply AI tools to explain unfamiliar code to support learning.
- Use AI-generated suggestions to debug code and resolve errors, while validating the proposed fixes.
- Generate boilerplate code and perform basic refactoring tasks using AI assistance.
- Use AI tools to draft technical documentation.
- Translate code between programming languages using AI assistance.
- Evaluate AI-generated code and explanations for correctness, efficiency, and alignment with project requirements.
- Analyze when AI assistance enhances productivity versus when it may obscure understanding or introduce errors.
