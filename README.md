# Coding with AI: Opportunities and Responsibilities for Researchers

This lesson is under development.

A practical introduction to using AI to support coding in research. This course will help researchers understand how AI coding assistants work, how to use them effectively, and how to do so responsibly. Designed for researchers with no experience in AI-assisted programming, the course provides clear, hands-on guidance for using AI to write, debug, and understand code, while addressing key ethical, security, and reliability considerations in research contexts.
