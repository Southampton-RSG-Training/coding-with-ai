:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What are some risks of biased, inaccurate, or unreliable AI-generated outputs?
- How can the use of AI tools compromise data privacy, security, or confidentiality in research and software development?
- What intellectual property and authorship issues emerge when AI contributes to code or written work?
- What are the long-term consequences of researchers relying on AI without developing core coding skills?
- What best practices can ensure that AI is used responsibly, ethically, and transparently in research workflows?
